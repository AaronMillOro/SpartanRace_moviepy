1. Generates short clips (resized and with variable speed) from videos recorded during the Spartan Race Andorra 2019 using a sports cam.
2. Videos are concantenated from a list containing all the clips
3. The final video is generated at defined fps and with music background

The original videos size ranged between 15 Mb to 1.4 Gb
Editing options are nicely detailed in the [documentation](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/index.html) of Moviepy
